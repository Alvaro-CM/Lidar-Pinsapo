Fusion &amp; R coding for the LIDAR Pinsapo Project

I am currently doing a PhD with a thesis in Remote Sensing and Vegetal Resources Ecology. I create this project to keep the code I am currently working with R and FUSION to analyze LIDAR point cloud in Spanish fir forests (Abies pinsapo). 

Feedback and suggestions are welcome!

Regards,

Alvaro.
